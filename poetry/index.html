            By the time you swear you’re his,<br>
            Shivering and sighing,<br>
            And he vows his passion is<br>
            Infinite, undying–<br>
            Lady, make a note of this:<br>
            One of you is lying.

            A test composed by my sluggishness,<br>
            Monitored by indulgence.<br>
            Multiple choices follow each question,<br>
            Each seeming less correct than the last.<br><br>
            Must I eliminate the false before it eliminates me?<br>
            And if I am eliminated,<br>
            I will not deject myself—<br>
            The choice was likely wrong to begin with.

            I never scheduled my playdates,<br>
            Was marked complete at the end of the slide.<br><br>
            Maintaining the cumbersome conformity,<br>
            Reaching back to youth,<br>
            Let’s all follow suit, and<br>
            Add a randomize button!

            Humanity depletes its natural resource,<br>

            The idle man waits for his interview.

            My candles can’t burn down<br>
            Any more.<br>
            They can’t burn anything down,<br>
            These days.<br>
            They just flicker with a false incandescence<br>
            Less and less…<br>
            Dimmer and dimmer…<br>
            As their batteries discharge.<br><br>

            I only replace them,<br>
            The batteries, I mean,<br>
            When you visit.<br>
            So between your visits,<br>
            Each night is dimmer and dimmer.<br>
            Until I am alone in the dark.
