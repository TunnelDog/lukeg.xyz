        <h2>June 19th, 2025 – 8:59 PM</h2>
        <p>Today I write to you feeling... broken.</p>

        <p>Something I had been looking forward to for months vanished just as I thought I had it. I'm talking about the Supreme racket, of course. I'm devastated, to be honest. But I will push forward nonetheless. After all, I could always buy it secondhand if I really want it that badly.</p>

        <p>We'll see how tomorrow's Kith for Wilson drop goes. If I'm unsuccessful with that as well (which is a real possibility), then I'll probably go ahead and buy the Supreme racket secondhand. I guess the bots just got to it faster than I did.</p>

        <p>Let me just say this, Blog. Supreme seriously needs to fix their captcha system. It always makes me redo it so many times, even when I get it right. This isn't just a personal issue, either. A lot of other people have voiced the same frustration.</p>

        <p>But alas, we push forward. I'm reminded of Matthew 6:19-20:</p>
        <blockquote>
          "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal."
        </blockquote>

        <p>That verse puts things into perspective. I'm still irritated about this morning's drop, and I don't find much comfort in self-pity when I reflect on that scripture. But I'm trying to see things in a more positive light.</p>

        <p>I also feel like I owe this blog an update on the situation. Unfortunately, I was unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>But following this paragraph, I'll share what I got in the Kith drop!</p>

        <h2>June 20th, 2025 – 10:21 PM</h2>
        <h3>Kith for Wilson Drop Recap</h3>

        <p>Today the Kith rackets came out, and I was semi-successful.</p>

        <p>Before I begin, let me set the scene. It's 10 a.m., the moment of the drop, and I'm out in the middle of nowhere on a distant ranch, loading a skid steer onto the back of a flatbed trailer. Not exactly the ideal setting to be buying limited-edition tennis rackets.</p>

        <p>Nonetheless, I was tightening the load binder with my right hand while trying to add items to my cart with the left hand. It took a while for the collection to appear because of the terrible service out there. When it finally loaded, I added the Pro Staff racket, the white tennis balls, and the olive crewneck to my cart and hit checkout.</p>

        <p>And y'all — I kid you not. I was hit with the exact same captcha from the Supreme drop.</p>
        <p>You already know how that goes.</p>

            <div class="image-caption">The white tennis balls I was trying to get</div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <img src="/blog/images/crewneck.jpg" alt="Kith for Wilson olive crewneck">
            <div class="image-caption">The olive crewneck I managed to grab</div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>I spent five minutes battling the captcha before finally getting through to the virtual queue. The estimated wait time was ten minutes. All three items were still marked "available," which gave me hope. But those ten minutes felt like the longest of my life. While we were finishing up the trailer, I kept glancing at my phone to check my spot in line.</p>

        <p>Everything was going fine for the first six minutes. Then, both the Pro Staff racket and the white tennis balls sold out. I was devastated but still managed to grab the crewneck.</p>

        <p>Later, once I had a bit more time, I checked the site again and saw that the rackets were back in stock with a "made to order" option. I bought one instantly — I was tired of missing out. But after completing the purchase, I realized those made-to-order rackets won't ship for six months. So I guess I've officially bought myself a Christmas gift.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I'm disappointed in how these drops played out. But at least I'm guaranteed to get the Kith racket eventually. And get this — I checked resale prices for the Supreme racket today, and they were already over $900. I've decided to wait and see if prices come down after more orders get fulfilled before considering a secondhand buy.</p>

        <p>Or maybe... these rackets just weren't meant to be.</p>
