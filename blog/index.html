        <h2>The Tennis Racket Craze: Supreme and Kith's Latest Collaborations</h2>
        <div class="blog-meta">

          <p>On Monday, February 17th, 2025, streetwear brand Supreme announced a collaboration with the popular tennis company Yonex. They're set to release an EZONE model frame in both red and black.</p>

          <p>When I first saw this announcement five months ago, I nearly fell out of my seat. As an avid tennis player and Supreme fan, I knew I had to get my hands on one of these rackets. I currently play with a Yonex VCORE 100L. However, my buddy Juan uses Yonex's other popular model, the EZONE. After hitting with both rackets, I realized the EZONE would probably be a better fit for me.</p>

          <p>Just when I was about to buy an EZONE for myself, Supreme announces the collaboration. "They made this racket for me," I thought. "It's my favorite brand literally making the exact model of tennis racket I was already going to buy!"</p>

          <p>For months, I checked weekly for the exact release date. Finally, on June 9th, 2025, @supcommunity on Instagram rumored a release for the upcoming Thursday. I was ecstatic and told all my friends it was finally happening. But then, on June 11th, @supcommunity claimed that the racket was no longer releasing. I was honestly pretty devastated.</p>

          <p>Luckily, that devastation didn't last long. Multiple sources soon confirmed the release date: Thursday, June 19th, 2025. The expected retail price for the racket is $428, which is definitely on the pricier side compared to Yonex's typical retail prices (usually around $300). The higher price might be due to the inclusion of a custom carrying case, though it hasn't been revealed yet.</p>

          <p>Regardless, I can't wait for Thursday. I'm super nervous, of course, since major Supreme collaborations are known to sell out within seconds.</p>

          <p>Just when I thought my days of scouting unreleased tennis rackets were behind me, Kith announced their collaboration with Wilson. This isn't the first time we've seen Kith for Wilson, they also collaborated in 2021 and 2023. Unfortunately, I wasn't into tennis back then, so I didn't buy anything from those collections. But this time is different.</p>

          <p>The Kith for Wilson collection is officially dropping on Friday, June 20th, 2025, just one day after the Supreme racket. I've spent the past year hunting through resale platforms like Grailed and Depop, searching for older Wilson x Kith pieces. They're extremely rare online, which leads me to believe there could be high resale margins on this new collection.</p>

          <p>Kith plans to release three different Wilson rackets along with a clean lineup of clothing and tennis accessories. In the past, they've done minimalist yet stylish T-shirts and crewnecks, plus tennis balls, shock absorbers, and sweatbands.</p>

              <div class="image-caption">Kith for Wilson Pro Staff</div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p>For this drop, the rackets will include a Wilson Shift, Pro Staff, and Blade. The only one that really catches my eye is the Pro Staff. Its deep green color contrasts beautifully with the white accents and the rest of the collection. I already own a Wilson Shift and, to be honest, it's not my favorite performing racket. As for the Blade, the Kith version looks way too similar to the Shift I already have.</p>

          <p>So I'll definitely be picking up the Wilson x Kith Pro Staff, and probably a few apparel items and accessories. I'm really hoping for some more shock absorbers and shirts featuring the Kith "Racket Crew" logo. The Pro Staff is expected to retail slightly under $300.</p>

          <p>With the Supreme racket, the Kith racket, and some Kith clothing, I'm probably looking at a total of around $900 spent in just two days. These high-end companies need to stop releasing tennis gear, because I will buy it. Lol.</p>
